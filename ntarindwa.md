The Blacklist is an American television series that premiered on NBC in 2013. The show follows Raymond "Red" Reddington, a former U.S. Navy officer turned high-profile criminal, who voluntarily surrenders to the FBI after eluding capture for decades. He offers to help them track down and apprehend some of the most dangerous criminals in the world, but he will only work with a rookie profiler named Elizabeth Keen.

As the show progresses, Reddington and Keen develop a complex and often tense relationship, as they work together to take down criminals on the FBI's "blacklist." The blacklist is a list of the most notorious criminals in the world, compiled by Reddington himself, who claims to have insider knowledge about their activities.

The show is known for its high-stakes action, intricate plot twists, and the enigmatic character of Reddington, who is played by James Spader. The series has been praised for its writing, acting, and production values, and has been nominated for several awards. It has also spawned a spin-off series, The Blacklist: Redemption.
